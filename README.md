# Ultrasonic Extension for MakeCode

![Ultrasonic Image](./icon.png)

This extension allows you to measure distances using an ultrasonic sensor with the micro:bit.

## Use as Extension

This repository can be added as an **extension** in MakeCode.

- open [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
- click on **New Project**
- click on **Extensions** under the gearwheel menu
- search for **bplab-dev/pxt-bplab-ultrasonic** and import

## üöÄ Features

- Easy distance measurement using ultrasonic sensors
- Support for multiple measurement units (microseconds, centimeters, inches)
- Configurable maximum distance measurement
- Simple block interface for easy integration
- Can be registered as a MakeCode extension for easy use
- Support for Korean

## Blocks

### üîç Summary: What each block does

| **Block ID**                 | **Function**                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| [`ping`](#ping-measurement-block) | Measure distance using ultrasonic sensor |

### 1. Ping Measurement Block

- üîπ Description

  - Measures the distance to an object using an ultrasonic sensor
  - Supports different measurement units:
    - Microseconds (Œºs)
    - Centimeters (cm)
    - Inches (inches)
  - Default maximum distance is 500cm

- üîπ Parameters
  - `trig`: Trigger pin for the ultrasonic sensor
  - `echo`: Echo pin for the ultrasonic sensor
  - `unit`: Measurement unit (Œºs, cm, or inches)
  - `maxCmDistance`: Maximum measurable distance in centimeters (optional)

- ‚úÖ Usage example

  ```blocks
  let ms = ultrasonic.ping(DigitalPin.P1, DigitalPin.P2, PingUnit.MicroSeconds)
  let cm = ultrasonic.ping(DigitalPin.P1, DigitalPin.P2, PingUnit.Centimeters)
  let inches = ultrasonic.ping(DigitalPin.P1, DigitalPin.P2, PingUnit.Inches)
  ```

## üîß How it works

The ultrasonic sensor sends out a pulse and measures the time it takes for the echo to return:

1. Trigger pin sends a 10Œºs pulse
2. Echo pin measures the return time
3. Distance is calculated based on the selected unit:
   - Centimeters = echo time / 58
   - Inches = echo time / 148
   - Microseconds = raw echo time
